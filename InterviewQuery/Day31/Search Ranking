You're given a table that represents search results from searches on Facebook. The `query` column is the search term, `position` column represents each position the search result came in, and the rating column represents the human rating of the result from 1 to 5 where 5 is high relevance and 1 is low relevance.

Write a query to get the percentage of search queries where all of the ratings for the query results are less than a rating of 3.
