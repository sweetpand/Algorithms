event_name	varchar
In the table above, column `event_name` represents either ('enter', 'post', 'cancel') for when a user starts a post (enter), ends up canceling it (cancel), or ends up posting it (post).

Write a query to get the post success rate for each day over the past week.

Sample:

user_id	created_at	event_name
123	2019-01-01	enter
123	2019-01-01	post
456	2019-01-02	enter
456	2019-01-02	cancel
